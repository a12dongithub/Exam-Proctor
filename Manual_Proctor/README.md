# Manual-Proctoring: Anonymize face for privacy



### Privacy Concerns :
Online proctoring has become a necessity in online teaching. The usage of video-based crowd-sourced online proctoring solutions, in which third-parties monitor an exam-taking student's video, raises privacy concerns. So, we hereby propose an online proctoring solution that protects privacy. When a student tries to cheat on an exam, the suggested image-hashing-based system can detect the student's excessive face and body movement (i.e., anomalies). Even if the student's face is blurred or masked in video frames, detection can be made.


### AI For All :
Students with motor tics or involuntary spasms, as well as those who flap or rock as self-stimulating (stimming) activities, may be highlighted for those motions. Needless to say, there are a variety of instances in which online proctoring would be ineffective for students with disabilities.Students may be forced to divulge sensitive medical information in order to prevent these problems. Manual proctoring is the only way out in such cases.
