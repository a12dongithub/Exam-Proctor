# Hackout
### Problem Statement : 
The onset of the pandemic has caused a paradigm shift in the way education is conducted. We have seen schools and colleges conducting classes online, and face various problems in operating as smoothly as they did traditionally. One of the factors which hinders this, is the lack of an effective proctoring system for exams conducted remotely. As part of this task, participants have to create an effective exam proctoring system to detect malpractices during conduction of an online exam.
