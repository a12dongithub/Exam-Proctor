# Head Pose Estimation:

What is pose estimation ?

In computer vision the pose of an object refers to its relative orientation and position with respect to a camera. You can change the pose by either moving the object with respect to the camera, or the camera with respect to the object.

The pose estimation problem described in this tutorial is often referred to as Perspective-n-Point problem or PNP in computer vision jargon. As we shall see in the following sections in more detail, in this problem the goal is to find the pose of an object when we have a calibrated camera, and we know the locations of n 3D points on the object and the corresponding 2D projections in the image.
